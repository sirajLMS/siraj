## 2026-09-08 - Optimizing availability & time calculation hot paths

**Learning:** Hot paths in schedule availability computation (`timeToMinutes`, `getUtcDateString`, date/time formatters, and gap range merging) were heavily allocating temporary arrays and strings (`split(":")`, `map(Number)`, `.padStart()`, array spreads, and `toSorted`).
**Action:** Replace `split` with `indexOf`/`slice` index parsing, replace `.padStart()` with ternary padding, eliminate intermediate spread copies, and convert date-time conversions directly to minutes to reduce GC pressure on search queries.
