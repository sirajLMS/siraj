# Backend GraphQL & Pothos Layer Rules

- **Framework**: We use Pothos to build our GraphQL schema code-first.
- **Nullability**: In Pothos, fields are non-nullable by default unless explicitly set to `nullable: true`. Ensure your TypeScript types align with your Pothos definitions.
- **Resolvers**: Pothos field resolvers should generally delegate to the `backend/services/` layer, rather than putting business logic inside the GraphQL definitions or calling Repositories directly.
- **Cache Updates**: Ensure `id` fields are always exposed on GraphQL objects so the Apollo client can auto-update its cache.
- **Locale Propagation & Localized Errors**: GraphQL field resolvers must propagate the request locale (`ctx.locale`) to service and repository calls to enable proper localized error messages. Any direct error thrown in resolvers should also be translated using next-intl (via `getBackendTranslations`).
