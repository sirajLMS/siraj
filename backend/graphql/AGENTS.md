# Backend GraphQL & Pothos Layer Rules

- **Framework**: We use Pothos to build our GraphQL schema code-first.
- **Nullability**: In Pothos, fields are non-nullable by default unless explicitly set to `nullable: true`. Ensure your TypeScript types align with your Pothos definitions.
- **Resolvers**: Pothos field resolvers should generally delegate to the `backend/services/` layer, rather than putting business logic inside the GraphQL definitions or calling Repositories directly.
- **Cache Updates**: Ensure `id` fields are always exposed on GraphQL objects so the Apollo client can auto-update its cache.
